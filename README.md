# react-fluxlike-mail-demo

demo application of a very basic email client using fluxlike architecture, react, and webpack


# TODO

- Action handlers
- Pre-load from local storage (when available)
- Bring in immutable js for data in stores
- Is there a lighter router to use than to include all of Backbone?
- Drop webpack in favor of browserify ?
