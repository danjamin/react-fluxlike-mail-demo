# react-fluxlike-mail-demo

demo application of a very basic email client using fluxlike architecture, react, and webpack

# Pre-reqs

Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)

# Running

Install dependencies, build and watch for changes:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

In a separate tab serve the web app:
```sh
$ npm run-script serve
```

# TODO

- Action handlers
- Pre-load from local storage (when available)
- Bring in immutable js for data in stores
- Is there a lighter router to use than to include all of Backbone?
- Drop webpack in favor of browserify ?
